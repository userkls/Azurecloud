## Virtualization 
Virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of computing resources—like servers, storage, networks, or operating systems—on top of physical hardware. 
It allows multiple independent environments to run on a single physical machine, improving efficiency, scalability, and flexibility.




## Benefits of Virtualization
Cost savings: Reduce hardware purchases by consolidating workloads.

Scalability: Easily add or remove virtual resources as demand changes.

Isolation: Each VM runs independently, improving security and stability.

Flexibility: Run different operating systems and applications on the same hardware.

Disaster recovery: Snapshots and backups make recovery faster and easier.



## Core Concept
Virtual machine: A software-based environment that acts like a physical computer.

Host machine: The physical computer providing resources (CPU, memory, storage).

Guest machine: The virtualized system running inside the host, with its own OS and apps.

Isolation: Each VM is sandboxed, meaning it runs independently without interfering with others.

## API
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as a bridge, enabling one program to access the functionality or data of another without needing to understand its internal workings.

### Core Idea
Interface between software: Just like a user interface connects people to computers, an API connects software systems.

Rules and protocols: Defines how requests and responses should be structured.



## Regions

Regions in cloud computing refer to geographic locations where cloud providers have data centers. Each region contains multiple data centers.

## Availability Zones

Availability Zones are isolated locations within a region that have their own power, cooling, and networking. They are designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance.

Availability Zones are isolated groups of datacenters within a cloud region, designed to provide high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery. Each zone has independent power, cooling, and networking, so if one fails, others continue to support workload

## Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system, application, or infrastructure to handle increasing workloads by adding resources without compromising performance.

## Elasticity

Elasticity in cloud computing refers to the ability to dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand.

## Agility

Agility is the capability of quickly and easily adapting to changes. In the context of cloud computing, it involves the rapid deployment of resources and applications.

## High Availability

High Availability (HA) ensures that a system or application is operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically 99.9% or higher.

## Fault Tolerance

Fault Tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating without interruption in the presence of hardware or software failures.

## Disaster Recovery

Disaster Recovery involves the planning and processes for restoring and recovering data and systems after a natural or human-induced disaster.

## Load Balancing

Load Balancing is the distribution of network traffic or computing workload across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
