## Core Concept
Virtual machine: A software-based environment that acts like a physical computer.

Host machine: The physical computer providing resources (CPU, memory, storage).

Guest machine: The virtualized system running inside the host, with its own OS and apps.

Isolation: Each VM is sandboxed, meaning it runs independently without interfering with others.
