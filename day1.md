## What is Cloud Computing ?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet, instead of relying on local hardware or private servers. It enables faster innovation, flexible resources, and cost efficiency.


## Why Cloud Matters
Cost savings: No upfront investment in servers; you pay-as-you-go.

Scalability: Handle peak traffic without overbuying hardware.

Performance & reliability: Global data centers ensure speed and redundancy.

Innovation: Access advanced tools like AI, analytics, and automation quickly.


## Types of Cloud Deployment
Public Cloud: Services shared across multiple organizations (e.g., Microsoft Azure, AWS).

Private Cloud: Dedicated infrastructure for one organization.

Hybrid Cloud: Mix of public and private, offering flexibility
