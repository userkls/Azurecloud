## Virtualization 
Virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of computing resources—like servers, storage, networks, or operating systems—on top of physical hardware. 
It allows multiple independent environments to run on a single physical machine, improving efficiency, scalability, and flexibility.




## Benefits of Virtualization
Cost savings: Reduce hardware purchases by consolidating workloads.

Scalability: Easily add or remove virtual resources as demand changes.

Isolation: Each VM runs independently, improving security and stability.

Flexibility: Run different operating systems and applications on the same hardware.

Disaster recovery: Snapshots and backups make recovery faster and easier.



## Core Concept
Virtual machine: A software-based environment that acts like a physical computer.

Host machine: The physical computer providing resources (CPU, memory, storage).

Guest machine: The virtualized system running inside the host, with its own OS and apps.

Isolation: Each VM is sandboxed, meaning it runs independently without interfering with others.

## API
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It acts as a bridge, enabling one program to access the functionality or data of another without needing to understand its internal workings.

### Core Idea
Interface between software: Just like a user interface connects people to computers, an API connects software systems.

Rules and protocols: Defines how requests and responses should be structured.

Abstraction: Developers don’t need to know the internal code—only how to interact with the API.
